      <p class="content-intro">Is your pool showing its age? Naples Pool Construction Company specializes in complete pool renovations that breathe new life into tired, outdated, or damaged pools. From simple resurfacing to dramatic full-scale remodels, we transform pools throughout Collier County into stunning modern retreats.</p>

      <h2>Expert Pool Renovation Services in Naples</h2>
      <p>Florida's intense sun, salt air, and chemical exposure take a toll on even the best-built pools. Over time, surfaces become rough and stained, tile cracks or falls off, equipment loses efficiency, and dated designs no longer reflect your taste or lifestyle. Pool renovation addresses all of these issues, often at a fraction of the cost of building new while delivering dramatic visual and functional improvements.</p>
      
      <p>Our renovation team has restored hundreds of pools throughout Naples, Marco Island, Bonita Springs, and surrounding communities. We understand the unique challenges of Southwest Florida pools—from the effects of high calcium content in our water to the specific structural considerations required by our soil conditions and climate. This local expertise ensures your renovation will look beautiful and perform flawlessly for years to come.</p>
      
      <p>Whether you want to update a single element or completely reimagine your pool area, we offer the comprehensive services and expert craftsmanship to bring your vision to life. Our design team can help you envision possibilities you might not have considered, from adding resort-style features to reconfiguring your deck for better flow and functionality.</p>

      <h2>Our Pool Renovation Services</h2>
      
      <h3>Pool Resurfacing</h3>
      <p>The interior finish is the most visible element of your pool and one of the first to show wear. Rough, stained, or discolored surfaces not only look unappealing but can harbor algae and irritate swimmers' skin. Our resurfacing services restore your pool's beauty and comfort with premium finish options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pebble Finishes:</strong> Natural pebble aggregates create stunning visual depth and exceptional durability. Brands like PebbleTec, PebbleSheen, and PebbleFina offer diverse color palettes from tropical lagoon blues to sophisticated charcoals.</li>
        <li><strong>Quartz Finishes:</strong> Quartz aggregates deliver brilliant sparkle and superior stain resistance. These finishes are particularly popular in Naples for their ability to maintain their beauty despite our challenging water chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>Plaster Finishes:</strong> Traditional white plaster and colored plaster remain popular choices for their classic look and value. Modern plaster formulations offer improved longevity compared to previous generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Glass Bead Finishes:</strong> For ultimate luxury, glass bead finishes create a luminous, jewel-like surface that shimmers in sunlight and moonlight alike.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Tile Replacement & Upgrade</h3>
      <p>Waterline tile defines your pool's character while protecting the most vulnerable area of your pool structure. Our tile services include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete waterline tile replacement</li>
        <li>Expansion to 6-inch or full-depth tile coverage</li>
        <li>Mosaic accents and custom designs</li>
        <li>Glass tile installations for contemporary elegance</li>
        <li>Natural stone tile for organic appeal</li>
        <li>Matching spa and feature tile coordination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We source tile from leading manufacturers and offer extensive selection assistance to help you choose the perfect complement to your renovation vision.</p>
      
      <h3>Coping Replacement</h3>
      <p>Coping—the cap around your pool's edge—endures significant stress from foot traffic, furniture, and thermal expansion. Cracked, loose, or dated coping detracts from your pool's appearance and can create safety hazards. We install premium coping materials including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural travertine and limestone</li>
        <li>Brick pavers in traditional and contemporary styles</li>
        <li>Poured-in-place concrete with custom textures</li>
        <li>Pre-cast concrete coping in various profiles</li>
        <li>Cantilevered concrete for seamless deck-to-pool transitions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Equipment Upgrades</h3>
      <p>Pool equipment technology has advanced dramatically in recent years. Upgrading outdated equipment improves energy efficiency, reduces maintenance, and enhances your swimming experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variable Speed Pumps:</strong> Cut energy costs by up to 80% compared to single-speed pumps while reducing noise and extending equipment life.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt Chlorine Generators:</strong> Enjoy softer water, eliminate chlorine handling, and reduce chemical costs with modern salt systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy-Efficient Heaters:</strong> Heat pump and high-efficiency gas heaters provide comfortable water temperatures with lower operating costs.</li>
        <li><strong>LED Lighting:</strong> Replace incandescent lights with color-changing LEDs that use 80% less energy and last years longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation Systems:</strong> Control your entire pool from your smartphone—pumps, lights, heaters, water features, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Filtration:</strong> Cartridge and DE filters provide superior water clarity with easier maintenance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Adding Water Features</h3>
      <p>Transform your pool from ordinary to extraordinary by adding water features during renovation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfalls:</strong> Natural rock waterfalls, sheer descent walls, and rain curtains add visual drama and soothing sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Fountains:</strong> Deck jets, bubblers, and laminar jets create playful water displays.</li>
        <li><strong>Grottos:</strong> Rock-formed grottos create shaded retreats with built-in seating.</li>
        <li><strong>Scuppers & Spillways:</strong> Architectural water features that complement modern pool designs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spa Additions</h3>
      <p>Adding a spa to your existing pool is one of the most requested renovation projects. Whether you envision a traditional attached spa or a dramatic raised spillover design, we engineer spa additions that integrate seamlessly with your existing pool structure and equipment.</p>

      <h3>Complete Pool Remodeling</h3>
      <p>For pools requiring comprehensive updates or homeowners seeking dramatic transformation, our complete remodeling services address every element:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structural repairs and waterproofing</li>
        <li>Shape modifications (where feasible)</li>
        <li>Adding sun shelves, beach entries, or tanning ledges</li>
        <li>Depth changes</li>
        <li>Complete deck replacement</li>
        <li>New plumbing and electrical</li>
        <li>Integration of all new features and finishes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signs Your Pool Needs Renovation</h2>
      <p>Not sure if it's time to renovate? Here are common indicators that your pool would benefit from professional attention:</p>
      <ul>
