      <h2>Pool Types We Build</h2>
      <p>Our custom pool construction capabilities encompass virtually any design style or configuration. Here are some of the pool types Naples homeowners most frequently request:</p>
      
      <h3>Geometric & Modern Pools</h3>
      <p>Clean lines, precise angles, and contemporary aesthetics define our geometric pool designs. Rectangle, square, and L-shaped configurations pair beautifully with modern architecture and create excellent lap lanes for fitness swimming. These pools often feature vanishing edges, raised walls, and minimalist finishes that emphasize sophisticated simplicity.</p>
      
      <h3>Freeform & Natural Pools</h3>
      <p>Curved, organic shapes that mimic natural lagoons and ponds create a tropical paradise feel perfect for Naples' resort lifestyle. Freeform pools integrate seamlessly with lush landscaping, rock formations, and water features to create environments that feel like private sanctuaries hidden from the outside world.</p>
      
      <h3>Infinity & Negative Edge Pools</h3>
      <p>For properties with views—whether overlooking the Gulf, a golf course, or a preserve—infinity edge pools create the stunning visual effect of water merging with the horizon. These sophisticated designs require precise engineering and expert construction, areas where our experience truly shines.</p>
      
      <h3>Resort-Style Pools</h3>
      <p>Sun shelves (Baja shelves), beach entries, swim-up bars, and integrated spas characterize our resort-style designs. These pools are designed for entertaining and family enjoyment, with multiple zones for different activities and age groups.</p>
      
      <h3>Lap Pools & Exercise Pools</h3>
      <p>Serious swimmers appreciate our lap pool designs, which maximize swimming lanes within available space. We also install swim-in-place systems and resistance jets for properties where a full-length lap pool isn't feasible.</p>
      
      <h3>Cocktail Pools (Spools)</h3>
      <p>For smaller properties or as secondary pools, cocktail pools—also known as spools—provide full-size pool features in a compact footprint. These intimate designs often include spa features and are perfect for relaxation and entertaining.</p>
